# C-plus-plus-Notes

Learning C++ coding, particularly on Visual Studio (so as to use this powerful tool more efficiently ;D )

It seems that C++ tutorials on YouTube are rarely on Visual Studio, or with an older version of VS, thus I will use more resources in Chinese, while this notes will be typed in English.

First complete prerequisite settings by following [this video on Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1U741157Rd?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0);\
then I will learn from this [tutorial series on Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ty4y1m7pZ?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0). My notes (at least from 2 to 7) would also follow this series.
