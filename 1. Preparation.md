## Preparation - software and setting
I use Visual Studio Code (VS code) on MacOS for C++ programming, as this allows multiple programming languages with ample variety of estensions. 

I follow this [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1U741157Rd?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0) 
for command line tool Xcode (which uses Clang ++ as complier on mac; requires around 20GB space) downloading, VS code extensions installation, etc.
